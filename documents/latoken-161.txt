LATOKEN Talent
Почему LATOKEN?
Трамплин на глобальный рынок с технологиями и культурой достижений, на удаленке
В Латокен мы помогаем запускать и покупать стартапы будущего. Это помогает предпринимателям получить поддержку, а инвесторам заработать. Мы согласуем краткосрочные эгоистичные интересы людей с долгосрочным общим процветанием. Инвесторы не голосуют за войны или несправедливость, стирающую стоимость их торговых счетов. Если Latoken не сможет демократизировать рынки капитала, миллиарды людей могут остаться оторванными от возможностей участвовать в создании будущего и зарабатывании на нем, что приведет к росту неравенства, разобщенности и в конечном итоге поставит под угрозу общее процветание.
Нам понадобится научиться листить лучшие токены первыми, а также сделать их ликвидными и легко понятными для торговли. Для этого мы используем ИИ, автоматизируя и расширяя продажи, а также обогащая информацию о токенах данными ончейн и социальными данными.
А самое главное, мы строим команду, которая на это способна. Мы считаем, что программировать научится ИИ, поэтому характер важнее навыков разработки.

Меня зовут Абдулманаб. Я воспитал 18 чемпионов мира по самбо, включая моего сына, и вошел в книгу рекордов Гиннеса. Мое тело умерло. Но идея, которую я развивал, может сделать нас с тобой вечными. Она простая, ты можешь сдвинуть границы возможного. Прими решение полюбить перегрузки. Радуйся, когда тебе тяжело, ведь от нагрузки ты вырастешь. Представь комфорт, как удушающее болото. Не общайся с теми, кто тебя в него тянет. Тебе не нужны их ритуалы коротания жизни до смерти. Ты родился улучшить мир.
Video title: Marc Andreessen on how to surround yourself with people you aspire to be #shorts - YouTubeHow does your social environment impact you and what should people do? There's an old adage that is absolutely true, which is basically any individual over time, you, you basically become the average of the five people you spend the most time with, you know, you zero in, you adapt, and it's a fundamental human instinct because everybody, you know, very few people can go through life alone, you need some sort of support network, your support network has a value system, and they have things they care about and things they're interested in, and you will tend to care about and be more interested in those things. If you don't have anybody around you who shares your interests, right, or has the same drives that you do, you'll have a very hard time sustaining it. And so, yeah, I mean, if you're going to be an entrepreneur, this is a very good reason to get to a startup hub geographically, if you can't geographically do that, you know, the next best thing is to, is to try to do that online. And, you know, one of the great things about the modern internet is in every different creative field, there are, you know, whatever Facebook groups to Reddit, to, you know, all these things where you, you can find yourself in communities where, you know, you're around people like that. And so I think, you know, the internet is an increasingly good substitute for that either way you go about it, though, like this, this is really critically important.

Video title: СЕО NVIDIA Дженсен Хуанг: Я буду пытать тебя до совершенства, потому что я в тебя верю - не сдавайся - YouTubePeople know that I rather torture them into greatness. That was the phrase that I was hoping to uncover. Yeah, I remember you mentioned that. Yeah, so I'd rather torture you into greatness because I believe in you. And I think coaches that really believe in their team torture them into greatness. And oftentimes, they're so close. Don't give up, they're so close. Greatness, it comes all of a sudden one day, I got it. Do you know what I'm saying? That feeling that you didn't get it yesterday and all of a sudden one day something clicked, oh, I got it. Could you imagine you gave up just that moment right before you got it? So I don't want you to give up on that. So let's just keep torturing you.

Video title: Marc Andreessen: The Courage and Genius Rule Every Startup Should Follow Once and For All! - YouTubeYou know courage without genius might not get you where you need to go But genius without courage almost certainly won't in this industry You don't have a business until you have a product the entrepreneur with the idea at the right time It's gonna look like a genius the entrepreneur with the right idea at the wrong time It's gonna look like a moron failure is a wonderful thing failure teaches you all this stuff And it's great to fail a lot like and we don't like buy any of that new companies generally shouldn't exist Existing companies are usually pretty good at what they do having the right idea and having at the right time and being able to execute On it is 99% of it no matter how dire it gets no matter how like evil Moriarty is Sure likes and I have that stroke of genius. It's gonna save the day. I think that the development career path skills training It's gonna be such a more fundamental part of how the economy works We my business partner my last company Ben Horowitz coined a term He calls the the law of crappy people you've been sitting here listening to me for 20 minutes And I've been working on this for five years, and you think you understand this so well that you can make me a suggestion He's an American entrepreneur venture capitalist and software engineer He's the co-founder and general partner of the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz He has an estimated net worth of six hundred million dollars. He's Mark Andreessen and here are his top ten rules for success The two things we really zero in on a people are you know two things they sound simple they end up being very difficult courage and genius Courage is the one we talk about a lot because it's the one that people can learn You know courage courage, which is to say not giving up in the face of adversity You know just being absolutely determined to succeed You know is something that you can you can like force yourself to do it can be very painful You can force yourself to do it the genius part is a little bit hard to force yourself to do You know courage without genius might not get you where you need to go But genius without courage almost certainly won't and so we're looking for some kind of magic combination of genius and courage We don't believe there's a tension between product and business We believe there's a staging which is in this industry You don't have a business until you have a product and in particular You don't have a business until you have a product that a lot of people want we have this concept We use a term product market fit Which is basically you have a product that the market wants and you can tell because the markets pulling the product and until you have That time spent building the business around the product is pointless because it's not gonna go anywhere like best case It's gonna be a zombie There's a lot of companies are in the valley as a lot of companies in the valley and elsewhere that are you know? 25 50 75 people they've got a product nobody really wants it They sell a few every quarter and they kind of you got a living and they go on for a year after year after year After year after year and they never get anywhere. They never go public They never get bought and people just basically collect salaries and that's not what that's like Not what we want to do and that's not what super, you know, super high potential entrepreneurs want to do So what we basically say is if you want to build a big success, you've got to nail the product You got it. Like it's got to be a killer product It's got to be something that has product market fit when you have product market fit Then you build a company around it, right? So then you build a sales force and then you start doing marketing and then you start doing business deals Then you start expanding internationally and you do all this other stuff and it's at that point where you start to apply a lot of capital and you build a big board and you start hiring executives and Doing all this stuff But a full executive team with a sales force and all that stuff before you have the killer product is a complete waste of time Entrepreneurs are often uniquely bad at wrapping their heads around timing because entrepreneurs by definition are highly optimistic people Because you have to be because you're starting a company and that you have to be highly optimistic if you're if you're gonna set off And do that And you're probably so optimistic that you're probably too aggressive on timing You probably assume that something is going to happen in the market faster than it's actually going to And so sometimes what you see happen, you see the Friendster, MySpace, Facebook scenario You see that happen a lot You see a company fail and then another company with the exact same idea six years later, and it's a huge success And it's just flat-out simply timing and I don't know what to say, you know Well, I don't know in general what to say about that in the specifics There's a lot of specific things that I think you do to try to address that you try to keep your burn rate low You try to give yourself runway for the market to develop, you know You try to correct for the fact that you're probably being too optimistic But I think in practice that's a lot of luck the entrepreneur with the idea at the right time is gonna look like a genius the entrepreneur with the right idea at the wrong time is Gonna look like a moron and it's really hard as an entrepreneur to tell the difference and by the way, right? There's always been this kind of thing in Silicon Valley of like, you know Sort of this I call it the failure fetish, right? It's failure is good, right? Failure you tell you guys are probably all have been taught this heard about this from a lot of people like failure is a wonderful Thing failure teaches you all this stuff and it's great to fail a lot like and we don't like buy any of that We think that's all complete complete nonsense We think failure sucks We think failure is a terribly terribly depressing thing to go through we think success on the other hand is wonderful I you know, you wouldn't think that this is something you have to actually say out loud But we do find it to be clarifying when we point it out And so we are strongly biased towards people who are so determined to succeed that they just they never give up. They never quit And I think that is a huge part of it And that's something we really look deep we look try to look deeply for we and you know That's the kind of thing that's not listed on a resume, right? That's something that has to be deep in somebody's fundamentally deep in somebody's character and you have to see it in their backgrounds New companies generally shouldn't exist Existing companies are usually pretty good at what they do And so for a new company to exist it not only has to like, you know come in to go You know going to business and bring a product to market But it has to bring a product to market that's so much better than what already exists that it punches through The sort of status quo and you know Most customers in most markets are pretty happy buying from the current suppliers And so there has to be a real kind of edge on the thing and we look for that in either a technology change Usually a technology change or an economic change Which are often the same thing the single best piece of advice I've ever heard I heard the other day watching Steve Martin the comedian on Charlie Rose and Steve Martin for the I'm sure everybody in the room knows Who Steve Martin is but he's one of the most successful comedians of the last, you know, 30 years Across many different media across television and movies and books and everything He's been tremendously successful and he recently wrote a book about it's actually really funny because it's it's it's a book about how he became Successful and it's not even a funny book. I mean, it's Steve Martin So it's a little bit funny, but it's not like a comedy book He actually sat down and wrote a book of like how I did it And in particular writing comedy comedy is a little bit like like startups in that There are a few comedians like Jerry Seinfeld or Steve Martin that are like hugely successful and then there's like, you know For every one of those there's 10,000 others, you know, who are still playing nightclubs, you know in very small towns So there's there's a huge dispersion from the big winners to a very large number of people who work Who work equally hard who don't get there? And he boiled it down to something that I think was incredibly insightful Obvious but insightful is you know, he said the He said young comedians always come to me and they say well, you know, how do I how do I be like you? How to be successful like you and he said, you know They're always looking for like how do I get an agent or how do I get booked or how do I get on The Tonight Show? Or how do I get it, you know get a movie role? And he said, you know, the real answer is be so good that they can't ignore you And it turns out that you know, he just and this is what his book talks about us He applied himself with a level of discipline at being an amazing comedian and it's really funny, right? Steve Martin's a great illustration of this because Steve Martin on stage is incredibly silly He's got the banjo and he's got the air If you watch this footage from the 70s when he was when he was up-and-coming, you know, he's got the arrow through his head He's like, you know dancing around. He's he's he's doing all this crazy stuff and it looks like he's just clowning But the level of discipline and rigor and practice that he put into it You know was astonishing over over a decade-long period and then, you know after a decade of hard work was a sudden overnight success The key point there being be so good that they can't ignore you if there's a form like this and a group like this and and and and efforts like like this and my blog and And all these things, you know, we we all talk a lot about the mechanics of how do you hire people or how do you? Raise money or how do you do this or how do you do that or how do you sell your company? And a lot of that it's important stuff But a lot of it is window dressing around the core Sort of proposition of the core problem Which is how to be so good that they can't ignore you and in a startup a lot of that has to do with Have an idea that's so good that they can't ignore you and you know the best idea having having the right idea and having at the right time and being able to execute on it is 99% of it and the rest of the rest of the stuff that we all talk about that I talk about all the time Is all kind of add-on ancillary to that. There are no silver bullets There are only lead bullets There's this there's this temptation when you especially when you get into crisis when you get into a real problem There's this temptation to think there must be a magic answer like there must be some stroke of genius You know there it's almost it's like what you I don't know if people watch the new Sherlock Holmes, you know TV series Which I just love it's like, you know Sherlock is gonna have you know No matter how dire it gets no matter how like evil Moriarty is Sherlock's gonna have that stroke of genius is gonna save the day and there's this really strong tendency to kind of think That that that that's out there and we see a lot of entrepreneurs that kind of cycle through different silver bullets And then they don't work and they don't work and they don't work Ben's point is always it's probably the answer is probably in firing a whole bunch of lead bullets And so the answer probably is you know, the engineers working, you know later at night for you know Six months and you know getting the next version of the product out and the answer is probably for you know The sales reps to go call on twice as many customers and try to close some more deals and the answer is probably to you Know your stock price is low You know go find the investors who are willing to invest when you're trading in half the cash because it turns out they actually do Exist and then your stock goes up a little bit and people start to regain confidence And so I would say I've you know, I've certainly come around to that point of view a lot And so when we work with entrepreneurs We often have very similar advice because it's kind of it'll be tempered through the very practical Realities of what you have to do to get through a situation like that I think our company systematically are too weak on helping people evolve in their careers and develop new skills And I think that same thing is true across the entire economy and you almost can't be too good at it The classic example in the valley right now is everybody needs mobile everybody's iOS programmers And so everybody's out trying to recruit the same It feels like there's only 3,000 like iOS programmers in the valley and everybody's trying to recruit them all It's like well, you've got like, you know, you've got a lot of these companies You've got Java programmers and you've got PHP programmers and you've got web programmers It's like, you know take, you know four months and and we actually there's a training company. We work with called big nerd ranch And they're spectacular. They literally are like it's a big nerd ranch It's like where you said you send people off and they train them and out of the iOS programmers at the big nerd ranch and Yeah, everybody's He's pointing to somebody who's been there And so, you know train people up on how to do these things We have another company called Udacity that does this kind of training now online and is rolling out all these tracks to be able To train people how to do mobile development or how to train people how to do a data science And so I think that the development career path Skills training is going to be such a more fundamental part of how the economy works and I think it has to be Because right today we're all hiring mobile developers, you know three years from now We're all gonna need to hire, you know, neural implant developers or whatever. It's gonna be I love it And we're gonna have that exact same problem again How do you as you grow the startup to be a lot bigger prevent mediocrity from creeping in? So I love this question Because I think there's a there's there's actually a way to think about this as a from a system standpoint, so My business partner my last company Ben Horowitz coined a term. He calls the the law of crappy people And we have focused on it a lot at my last company. We focus on it in my current company And basically the law of crappy people It's basically a derivation of the concept that a people hire a people and B people hire C people which is kind of a cliche And everybody kind of knows that but the law of crappy people kicks in as you grow and what the law of crappy people really is is that the The capabilities or the competence of the people at any level in your company as you grow Are going to degrade to the worst person at that level in your company and so your Your vice presidents over time are all going to be as bad as your worst vice president Your directors over time are all going to be as bad as your worst director your engineers over time are all going to be as bad as your worst engineer and the reason is because The way that hiring decisions get made and the way that promotion decisions get made inside a company is within reference to the people who are Already there, and so I'm a manager. I want Joe to get promoted from engineers engineer to senior engineer My argument is he's a really good engineer and the other you know executives who are battling for promotions for their people say well He's not that good, and then I say well. He's at least as good as you know Bob. You know who's your guy? Who is a senior engineer? And you know you're like okay? Yeah? Well? Yeah? I guess that's true You know Bob isn't that great Bob is a senior engineer so clearly Joe should also be a senior engineer And before you know it all your senior engineers are as bad as Bob, and it's it's it's it's absolutely astonishing It's absolutely astonishing to watch because it basically degrades if somebody's significantly better than the worst person they get promoted And when new people get hired, you know they get they get hired in reference to the worst person to level So it's basically on a level by level basis And you basically need to just beat it back with a stick I mean you need to be like so determined to not have the standards of their term that people use the soft bigotry of low expectations you need to be absolutely determined to have your definition of good not be the average of the people we have in the company or The person who was accidentally promoted to a certain level who really shouldn't have been but now that he is that's the definition of the Level because because he's now part of it And you just you just need to absolutely beat it back with a stick and one of the heuristics I think you can use to beat it back is to ask yourself a question on every hire and on every promotion Is are you are you raising the average? Because you're probably either if you're hiring somebody or promoting somebody you're either going to be raising the average at that level Or for that role in the company, or you're going to be lowering the average And if you're continuously raising the average which is very hard to do then you're going to defeat the law crappy people But if you're not super focused and super determined on that then it will inevitably degrade Really bright founders with these really radical ideas tend to go through with a call the idea maze So they tend to have worked for years Working their way through the idea to try to figure out how to get from kind of the initial crazy starting point at the end Something that will actually work in the real world And the really great entrepreneurs can walk you through the idea maze and make you understand the flow of thinking that got got them to The point where they actually came out the other end with what is a great idea? And what's in it? What's interesting about that is those are generally not there's this kind of you know theory in venture capital You want to back coachable entrepreneurs? The entrepreneurs who really have the radical ideas are generally not only not coachable. They generally react with hostility to being coached and so one of the things we test for is You know basically say well, you know have you thought about doing it this other way and what we're not looking for is the oh That's a great idea What we are looking for is the stare. That's just like you idiot Right, you moron you've been sitting here listening to you know, this is them talking to me You've been sitting here listening to me for 20 minutes I've been working on this for five years and you think you understand this so well that you can make me a suggestion and Not only are you an idiot for thinking you can do that? But I will now explain to you in detail why you're that big of an idiot. We love those Like those are fantastic. Those are outstanding And so and it goes right back to the combination of genius and courage I was talking about And so in particular, I mean it's part of us in the words, but also part of it's just the look on the face Oh, we love that. Look It's like caviar. Thank you guys so much for watching. I made this video because FBGM 247 asked me to so if there's a famous entrepreneur that you want me to profile next leave in the comments below and I'll see What I can do I'd also love to know which of Mark's top 10 rules hit you the hardest is going to have the biggest impact on your business And why leave in the comments? I'll join in the discussion. Thank you so much for watching continue to believe and I'll see you soon

Video title: Marc Andreessen: The Courage and Genius Rule Every Startup Should Follow Once and For All! - YouTubeYou know courage without genius might not get you where you need to go But genius without courage almost certainly won't in this industry You don't have a business until you have a product the entrepreneur with the idea at the right time It's gonna look like a genius the entrepreneur with the right idea at the wrong time It's gonna look like a moron failure is a wonderful thing failure teaches you all this stuff And it's great to fail a lot like and we don't like buy any of that new companies generally shouldn't exist Existing companies are usually pretty good at what they do having the right idea and having at the right time and being able to execute On it is 99% of it no matter how dire it gets no matter how like evil Moriarty is Sure likes and I have that stroke of genius. It's gonna save the day. I think that the development career path skills training It's gonna be such a more fundamental part of how the economy works We my business partner my last company Ben Horowitz coined a term He calls the the law of crappy people you've been sitting here listening to me for 20 minutes And I've been working on this for five years, and you think you understand this so well that you can make me a suggestion He's an American entrepreneur venture capitalist and software engineer He's the co-founder and general partner of the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz He has an estimated net worth of six hundred million dollars. He's Mark Andreessen and here are his top ten rules for success The two things we really zero in on a people are you know two things they sound simple they end up being very difficult courage and genius Courage is the one we talk about a lot because it's the one that people can learn You know courage courage, which is to say not giving up in the face of adversity You know just being absolutely determined to succeed You know is something that you can you can like force yourself to do it can be very painful You can force yourself to do it the genius part is a little bit hard to force yourself to do You know courage without genius might not get you where you need to go But genius without courage almost certainly won't and so we're looking for some kind of magic combination of genius and courage We don't believe there's a tension between product and business We believe there's a staging which is in this industry You don't have a business until you have a product and in particular You don't have a business until you have a product that a lot of people want we have this concept We use a term product market fit Which is basically you have a product that the market wants and you can tell because the markets pulling the product and until you have That time spent building the business around the product is pointless because it's not gonna go anywhere like best case It's gonna be a zombie There's a lot of companies are in the valley as a lot of companies in the valley and elsewhere that are you know? 25 50 75 people they've got a product nobody really wants it They sell a few every quarter and they kind of you got a living and they go on for a year after year after year After year after year and they never get anywhere. They never go public They never get bought and people just basically collect salaries and that's not what that's like Not what we want to do and that's not what super, you know, super high potential entrepreneurs want to do So what we basically say is if you want to build a big success, you've got to nail the product You got it. Like it's got to be a killer product It's got to be something that has product market fit when you have product market fit Then you build a company around it, right? So then you build a sales force and then you start doing marketing and then you start doing business deals Then you start expanding internationally and you do all this other stuff and it's at that point where you start to apply a lot of capital and you build a big board and you start hiring executives and Doing all this stuff But a full executive team with a sales force and all that stuff before you have the killer product is a complete waste of time Entrepreneurs are often uniquely bad at wrapping their heads around timing because entrepreneurs by definition are highly optimistic people Because you have to be because you're starting a company and that you have to be highly optimistic if you're if you're gonna set off And do that And you're probably so optimistic that you're probably too aggressive on timing You probably assume that something is going to happen in the market faster than it's actually going to And so sometimes what you see happen, you see the Friendster, MySpace, Facebook scenario You see that happen a lot You see a company fail and then another company with the exact same idea six years later, and it's a huge success And it's just flat-out simply timing and I don't know what to say, you know Well, I don't know in general what to say about that in the specifics There's a lot of specific things that I think you do to try to address that you try to keep your burn rate low You try to give yourself runway for the market to develop, you know You try to correct for the fact that you're probably being too optimistic But I think in practice that's a lot of luck the entrepreneur with the idea at the right time is gonna look like a genius the entrepreneur with the right idea at the wrong time is Gonna look like a moron and it's really hard as an entrepreneur to tell the difference and by the way, right? There's always been this kind of thing in Silicon Valley of like, you know Sort of this I call it the failure fetish, right? It's failure is good, right? Failure you tell you guys are probably all have been taught this heard about this from a lot of people like failure is a wonderful Thing failure teaches you all this stuff and it's great to fail a lot like and we don't like buy any of that We think that's all complete complete nonsense We think failure sucks We think failure is a terribly terribly depressing thing to go through we think success on the other hand is wonderful I you know, you wouldn't think that this is something you have to actually say out loud But we do find it to be clarifying when we point it out And so we are strongly biased towards people who are so determined to succeed that they just they never give up. They never quit And I think that is a huge part of it And that's something we really look deep we look try to look deeply for we and you know That's the kind of thing that's not listed on a resume, right? That's something that has to be deep in somebody's fundamentally deep in somebody's character and you have to see it in their backgrounds New companies generally shouldn't exist Existing companies are usually pretty good at what they do And so for a new company to exist it not only has to like, you know come in to go You know going to business and bring a product to market But it has to bring a product to market that's so much better than what already exists that it punches through The sort of status quo and you know Most customers in most markets are pretty happy buying from the current suppliers And so there has to be a real kind of edge on the thing and we look for that in either a technology change Usually a technology change or an economic change Which are often the same thing the single best piece of advice I've ever heard I heard the other day watching Steve Martin the comedian on Charlie Rose and Steve Martin for the I'm sure everybody in the room knows Who Steve Martin is but he's one of the most successful comedians of the last, you know, 30 years Across many different media across television and movies and books and everything He's been tremendously successful and he recently wrote a book about it's actually really funny because it's it's it's a book about how he became Successful and it's not even a funny book. I mean, it's Steve Martin So it's a little bit funny, but it's not like a comedy book He actually sat down and wrote a book of like how I did it And in particular writing comedy comedy is a little bit like like startups in that There are a few comedians like Jerry Seinfeld or Steve Martin that are like hugely successful and then there's like, you know For every one of those there's 10,000 others, you know, who are still playing nightclubs, you know in very small towns So there's there's a huge dispersion from the big winners to a very large number of people who work Who work equally hard who don't get there? And he boiled it down to something that I think was incredibly insightful Obvious but insightful is you know, he said the He said young comedians always come to me and they say well, you know, how do I how do I be like you? How to be successful like you and he said, you know They're always looking for like how do I get an agent or how do I get booked or how do I get on The Tonight Show? Or how do I get it, you know get a movie role? And he said, you know, the real answer is be so good that they can't ignore you And it turns out that you know, he just and this is what his book talks about us He applied himself with a level of discipline at being an amazing comedian and it's really funny, right? Steve Martin's a great illustration of this because Steve Martin on stage is incredibly silly He's got the banjo and he's got the air If you watch this footage from the 70s when he was when he was up-and-coming, you know, he's got the arrow through his head He's like, you know dancing around. He's he's he's doing all this crazy stuff and it looks like he's just clowning But the level of discipline and rigor and practice that he put into it You know was astonishing over over a decade-long period and then, you know after a decade of hard work was a sudden overnight success The key point there being be so good that they can't ignore you if there's a form like this and a group like this and and and and efforts like like this and my blog and And all these things, you know, we we all talk a lot about the mechanics of how do you hire people or how do you? Raise money or how do you do this or how do you do that or how do you sell your company? And a lot of that it's important stuff But a lot of it is window dressing around the core Sort of proposition of the core problem Which is how to be so good that they can't ignore you and in a startup a lot of that has to do with Have an idea that's so good that they can't ignore you and you know the best idea having having the right idea and having at the right time and being able to execute on it is 99% of it and the rest of the rest of the stuff that we all talk about that I talk about all the time Is all kind of add-on ancillary to that. There are no silver bullets There are only lead bullets There's this there's this temptation when you especially when you get into crisis when you get into a real problem There's this temptation to think there must be a magic answer like there must be some stroke of genius You know there it's almost it's like what you I don't know if people watch the new Sherlock Holmes, you know TV series Which I just love it's like, you know Sherlock is gonna have you know No matter how dire it gets no matter how like evil Moriarty is Sherlock's gonna have that stroke of genius is gonna save the day and there's this really strong tendency to kind of think That that that that's out there and we see a lot of entrepreneurs that kind of cycle through different silver bullets And then they don't work and they don't work and they don't work Ben's point is always it's probably the answer is probably in firing a whole bunch of lead bullets And so the answer probably is you know, the engineers working, you know later at night for you know Six months and you know getting the next version of the product out and the answer is probably for you know The sales reps to go call on twice as many customers and try to close some more deals and the answer is probably to you Know your stock price is low You know go find the investors who are willing to invest when you're trading in half the cash because it turns out they actually do Exist and then your stock goes up a little bit and people start to regain confidence And so I would say I've you know, I've certainly come around to that point of view a lot And so when we work with entrepreneurs We often have very similar advice because it's kind of it'll be tempered through the very practical Realities of what you have to do to get through a situation like that I think our company systematically are too weak on helping people evolve in their careers and develop new skills And I think that same thing is true across the entire economy and you almost can't be too good at it The classic example in the valley right now is everybody needs mobile everybody's iOS programmers And so everybody's out trying to recruit the same It feels like there's only 3,000 like iOS programmers in the valley and everybody's trying to recruit them all It's like well, you've got like, you know, you've got a lot of these companies You've got Java programmers and you've got PHP programmers and you've got web programmers It's like, you know take, you know four months and and we actually there's a training company. We work with called big nerd ranch And they're spectacular. They literally are like it's a big nerd ranch It's like where you said you send people off and they train them and out of the iOS programmers at the big nerd ranch and Yeah, everybody's He's pointing to somebody who's been there And so, you know train people up on how to do these things We have another company called Udacity that does this kind of training now online and is rolling out all these tracks to be able To train people how to do mobile development or how to train people how to do a data science And so I think that the development career path Skills training is going to be such a more fundamental part of how the economy works and I think it has to be Because right today we're all hiring mobile developers, you know three years from now We're all gonna need to hire, you know, neural implant developers or whatever. It's gonna be I love it And we're gonna have that exact same problem again How do you as you grow the startup to be a lot bigger prevent mediocrity from creeping in? So I love this question Because I think there's a there's there's actually a way to think about this as a from a system standpoint, so My business partner my last company Ben Horowitz coined a term. He calls the the law of crappy people And we have focused on it a lot at my last company. We focus on it in my current company And basically the law of crappy people It's basically a derivation of the concept that a people hire a people and B people hire C people which is kind of a cliche And everybody kind of knows that but the law of crappy people kicks in as you grow and what the law of crappy people really is is that the The capabilities or the competence of the people at any level in your company as you grow Are going to degrade to the worst person at that level in your company and so your Your vice presidents over time are all going to be as bad as your worst vice president Your directors over time are all going to be as bad as your worst director your engineers over time are all going to be as bad as your worst engineer and the reason is because The way that hiring decisions get made and the way that promotion decisions get made inside a company is within reference to the people who are Already there, and so I'm a manager. I want Joe to get promoted from engineers engineer to senior engineer My argument is he's a really good engineer and the other you know executives who are battling for promotions for their people say well He's not that good, and then I say well. He's at least as good as you know Bob. You know who's your guy? Who is a senior engineer? And you know you're like okay? Yeah? Well? Yeah? I guess that's true You know Bob isn't that great Bob is a senior engineer so clearly Joe should also be a senior engineer And before you know it all your senior engineers are as bad as Bob, and it's it's it's it's absolutely astonishing It's absolutely astonishing to watch because it basically degrades if somebody's significantly better than the worst person they get promoted And when new people get hired, you know they get they get hired in reference to the worst person to level So it's basically on a level by level basis And you basically need to just beat it back with a stick I mean you need to be like so determined to not have the standards of their term that people use the soft bigotry of low expectations you need to be absolutely determined to have your definition of good not be the average of the people we have in the company or The person who was accidentally promoted to a certain level who really shouldn't have been but now that he is that's the definition of the Level because because he's now part of it And you just you just need to absolutely beat it back with a stick and one of the heuristics I think you can use to beat it back is to ask yourself a question on every hire and on every promotion Is are you are you raising the average? Because you're probably either if you're hiring somebody or promoting somebody you're either going to be raising the average at that level Or for that role in the company, or you're going to be lowering the average And if you're continuously raising the average which is very hard to do then you're going to defeat the law crappy people But if you're not super focused and super determined on that then it will inevitably degrade Really bright founders with these really radical ideas tend to go through with a call the idea maze So they tend to have worked for years Working their way through the idea to try to figure out how to get from kind of the initial crazy starting point at the end Something that will actually work in the real world And the really great entrepreneurs can walk you through the idea maze and make you understand the flow of thinking that got got them to The point where they actually came out the other end with what is a great idea? And what's in it? What's interesting about that is those are generally not there's this kind of you know theory in venture capital You want to back coachable entrepreneurs? The entrepreneurs who really have the radical ideas are generally not only not coachable. They generally react with hostility to being coached and so one of the things we test for is You know basically say well, you know have you thought about doing it this other way and what we're not looking for is the oh That's a great idea What we are looking for is the stare. That's just like you idiot Right, you moron you've been sitting here listening to you know, this is them talking to me You've been sitting here listening to me for 20 minutes I've been working on this for five years and you think you understand this so well that you can make me a suggestion and Not only are you an idiot for thinking you can do that? But I will now explain to you in detail why you're that big of an idiot. We love those Like those are fantastic. Those are outstanding And so and it goes right back to the combination of genius and courage I was talking about And so in particular, I mean it's part of us in the words, but also part of it's just the look on the face Oh, we love that. Look It's like caviar. Thank you guys so much for watching. I made this video because FBGM 247 asked me to so if there's a famous entrepreneur that you want me to profile next leave in the comments below and I'll see What I can do I'd also love to know which of Mark's top 10 rules hit you the hardest is going to have the biggest impact on your business And why leave in the comments? I'll join in the discussion. Thank you so much for watching continue to believe and I'll see you soon

Video title: Ben Horowitz: Peacetime vs. Wartime CEO - YouTubeIf you read in the management literature, it's almost entirely written for peacetime CEOs. So like everything you learn about decision-making and delegation and don't micromanage and all these things are very peacetime oriented in the sense that in peacetime, you're much more focused on the development of the people and the development of the organization over the long term and the ability for the organization outside of yourself to make higher quality decisions. And then also kind of be creative outside of the mission. And that's kind of all affordable if like you've got say like you've got Google search and you're just like running, steamrolling through the industry, then you can do a lot more kind of peacetime sort of things. On the other hand, right, if you're running out of cash or if you're like Apple when Steve Jobs first took over and they had three weeks of cash left and so forth, like you can't actually like that's not affordable in the decision-making process. You've got to get to a very accurate decision extremely quickly. And that's when you kind of have like a hit, that's when the wartime techniques come into play. And sometimes in wartime, you end up doing things that actually do undermine the development of the organization because there is more burden on the CEO to make a much larger number of decisions because accuracy is so important and the CEO by virtue of her position has got more knowledge to make those decisions and more authority too to make them definitive and fast and high quality. So that is a lot about what that was about. And I thought a lot of it came from Andy Grove has a great book called Only the Paranoid Survive, which a lot of you probably have read here. But there is a part of it where he talks about when he turned Intel from the memory business into the CPU business, which is like a real wartime story. Like it's like okay, like I walked into the room and I was like okay, what would we do if we were, if I was fired tomorrow and then like somebody came in to replace me and then all my whole staff was fired and replaced all of them, what would they do with the business? And then like I walked out to the car, like I had a cigarette, I looked out into the distance, I was like all right, we've got to lay off 80% of the people. And those kinds of things are just not things that you kind of normally encounter in the business education, but in the real business world that's like most of it, most of it ends up being wartime, particularly in startup world like a huge amount of it ends up being wartime, so.
